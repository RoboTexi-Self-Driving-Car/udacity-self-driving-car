- **calibration_wide:** Contains the calibration images for the program



**Repository:** https://github.com/YashBansod/udacity-self-driving-car/Camera-Calibration/



The IPython notebook in this repository contains code to calculate the camera matrix and distortion coefficients using the images in the "calibration_wide" folder.

The project was copied from 
[CarND-Camera-Calibration](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Camera-Calibration)
which is a part of the Term 1 of 
[Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree Program](https://in.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).
